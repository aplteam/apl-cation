# APL-Cation

Homepage for all members of the APL-Cation project.

The APL-Cation project comprehends full-blown applications that support Dyalog APL programmers during the development cycle.

The APL-Cation project is an Open Source project; all members run under the - relaxed - MIT license.

For more information about the APL-Cation project see the wiki in this project.

Note that prior to 2018-02 those applications have been part of the [APLTree library](https://github.com/aplteam/apltree). 

They are now independent from the APLTree project which is now just a library for Dyalog APL.
